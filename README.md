### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A creative, skilled & disciplined analyst/programmer with a natural flair for translating business requirements into efficient and effective IT solutions. An experienced Delphi developer who excels in working autonomously or as part of a team, and possesses excellent communication, presentation & business skills.

I develop computer software for a living, most recently in the healthcare arena. I love developing innovative solutions to problems & I'm justifiably proud of the projects I've implemented.

I've mostly developed in Delphi and I'm now increasing my skillset with HTML/CSS/JS and Angular, Typescript. I've used Bootstrap & SemanticUI frameworks and have built static sites with Hugo.

I'm pretty active; I believe a healthy body is key to a healthy mind. I lift weights four to five times a week minimum & ride my Friesian gelding as regularly as I can.

I exercise my creative muscle with photography and miscellaneous design & website work for select clients, friends & family. During 2011 through to 2013 I jointly operated a part-time photography business for events, wedding and studio shoots, covering some 80+ events in 3 years.
