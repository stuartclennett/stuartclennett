### Hi there 👋

I'm a creative, skilled & disciplined developer with a natural flair for translating business requirements into efficient and effective IT solutions. I'm a developer with 35 years experience and can work autonomously or as part of a team, and possess excellent communication, presentation & business skills.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects for remote learning, print production, clinical systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux.  And Javascript. On repeat. Like everyone else.
