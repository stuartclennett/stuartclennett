### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative, skilled & disciplined developer with a natural flair for translating business requirements into efficient and effective IT solutions. I'm a developer with 35 years experience and can work autonomously or as part of a team, and possess excellent communication, presentation & business skills.

I develop computer software for a living, most recently in the healthcare market. I love developing innovative solutions to problems & I'm justifiably proud of the projects I've implemented.

I've mostly developed in Delphi and I've increased my skillset with HTML/CSS/JS using Angular & Typescript. I've used various CSS frameworks and have built static sites with Hugo.

I'm pretty active; I believe a healthy body is key to a healthy mind. I lift weights four to five times a week minimum & ride both my bike and Friesian as regularly as I can.

I exercise my creative muscle with photography and miscellaneous design & website work for select clients, friends & family. During 2011 through to 2013 I jointly operated a part-time photography business for events, wedding and studio shoots, covering some 80+ events in 3 years.
